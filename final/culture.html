            <h2>Anime Art Styles</h2>
            <p>
                Anime is known for its expressive, stylized artwork. While all studios and artists add their own
                creative touch, most anime fits into a few common art styles. Understanding these styles can help
                viewers appreciate the design choices and storytelling techniques used in different series.

            <h3>1. Chibi (Super-Deformed)</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Chibi</strong> characters are intentionally drawn small with oversized heads, big eyes,
                and simple features. This style is often used for comedy moments, quick emotional reactions,
                or cute bonus scenes.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What to expect:</strong> adorable expressions, exaggerated humor, lighthearted tone.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>2. Realistic Style</h3>
            <p>
                Some anime use a more realistic approach, with detailed anatomy, natural proportions, and subtle
                expressions. These shows often target older teens or adults and use mature, grounded storytelling.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Violet Evergarden, Ghost in the Shell.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>3. Stylized / Artistic</h3>
            <p>
                Many anime combine artistic exaggeration with unique visual themes — bold color schemes, unusual
                shading, or surreal environments. Studio Ghibli, Trigger, and MAPPA are well-known for their
                signature styles.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Kill la Kill, Spirited Away, Mob Psycho 100</p>

            <h2>Cosplay: Bringing Characters to Life</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Cosplay</strong> (short for “costume play”) is a popular way for fans to express creativity
                and appreciation for their favorite characters. Cosplayers design or buy costumes, apply makeup,
                and pose or perform in character.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many view cosplay as an art form — it teaches sewing, crafting, confidence, and dedication. It is
                also a great way to connect with a positive community of fans who share similar interests.
            </p>
            <p>
                As always, choosing modest, respectful, and Honor Code-friendly cosplay options helps maintain
                dignity while still enjoying the creativity of the hobby.

            <h2>Anime Conventions</h2>
            <p>
                Anime conventions are gatherings where fans come together to celebrate Japanese pop culture.
                They usually include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cosplay contests and photoshoots</li>
                <li>Panels with voice actors, artists, and creators</li>
                <li>Manga and art vendors</li>
                <li>Workshops for drawing, crafting, or animation</li>
                <li>Screenings of anime episodes or movies</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Conventions offer a fun, social environment where fans can meet new friends, learn new skills, and
                discover new shows — all while staying connected to uplifting and positive fan communities.

            <h2>Online Anime Communities</h2>
            <p>
                Today, fans often gather online to talk about new episodes, share theories, create fan art, or
                discuss favorite characters. Popular platforms include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reddit anime communities</li>
                <li>Discord groups</li>
                <li>Instagram and TikTok fan pages</li>
                <li>MyAnimeList forums</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These communities can be positive places to make friends, but it's always important to stay safe,
                respectful, and mindful of the media you consume. Choosing uplifting and clean content ensures that
                your anime experience strengthens you instead of dragging you down.
