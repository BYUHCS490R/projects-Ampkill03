            <h2>How to Choose Genres That Fit You</h2>
            <p>
                When choosing a genre, think about how you want to feel:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do you want to feel <strong>motivated</strong>? Try shounen or sports anime.</li>
                <li>Do you want something <strong>sweet or emotional</strong>? Try shoujo or slice of life.</li>
                <li>Do you want something <strong>deep and complex</strong>? Look at seinen (but check the content first).</li>
                <li>Do you want <strong>imaginative worlds</strong>? Isekai and fantasy genres are a good match.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                No matter what genre you pick, it's always a good idea to check a short summary and a review first. This helps you avoid content that doesn't match your standards and focus on shows that are uplifting, clean, and worth your time.
