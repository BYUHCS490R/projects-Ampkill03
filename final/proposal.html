    <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
    <h2>Student: Aloe Pereira</h2>

    <h3>1. The title and topic of my site</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Title:</strong> Aloe's Anime Hub<br>
        <strong>Topic:</strong> A website that highlights popular anime, beginner recommendations, 
        character spotlights, anime genres, and anime fan culture.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Why I chose this topic</h3>
    <p>
        I chose anime as my topic because it has been one of my favorite hobbies for many years. 
        Anime inspires creativity and teaches powerful lessons about courage, friendship, 
        sacrifice, and growth. I enjoy the art styles, the stories, and the emotions that anime 
        can express. By creating this site, I want to share helpful recommendations and explain 
        anime in a positive, uplifting way. I will make sure all content is appropriate and 
        follows the Honor Code.

        images, I will use copyright-free resources (public domain or Creative Commons) and make 
        sure I follow the rules for using each image. I will not upload copyrighted screenshots 
        or fan art without permission.
