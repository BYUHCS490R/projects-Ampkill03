        <p><strong>Please describe the parent-child relationship in HTML and why it becomes essential when using flex and grid.</strong></p>
        <p>In HTML, the parent-child relationship means one element (the parent) contains another element (the child) inside it. This is important because it decides how elements are connected and displayed on a webpage. When using Grid, the parent element controls how its child elements are arranged like in rows, columns, or evenly spaced boxes. Only the direct children of a grid container follow those layout rules. Without this parent-child setup, Grid layouts won't work correctly.</p>
        <p><strong>What are the two main differences between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?</strong></p>
        <p>Flexbox is one-dimensional, arranging items in a single row or column, while Grid is two-dimensional, controlling both rows and columns.</p>
        <p>Flexbox focuses on aligning content based on its size, while Grid focuses on creating structured layouts with predefined rows and columns.</p>
