        <h1>Questions</h1>
        <h2>What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?</h2>
        <p>JPEG is good for photos with lots of colors, like pictures of people, nature, or anything with smooth color changes.
        </p>
        <h2>What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?</h2>
        <p>GIF is good for simple pictures with few colors, like cartoons, logos, or small animations.
        </p>
        <h2>What is unique about the PNG format?</h2>
        <p>PNG keeps the picture clear and sharp without losing quality and can have see-through parts</p>
        <h2>How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</h2>
        <p>You use a program like photoshop or photos to make the picture smaller or bigger by changing its actual size.</p>
        <h2>Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS?</h2>
        <p>Because changing the size in a program makes the file smaller and faster to load, but resizing with CSS only changes how it looks on screen without making the file smaller.
