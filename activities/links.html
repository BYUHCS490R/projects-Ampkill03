        <p><strong>What is the root?</strong></p>
        <p>The root is the main storage unit where the file is stored in</p>
        <p><strong>What is the relationship between folder and file names and the path?</strong></p>
        <p>The relationship between the file and folder is that the file path will show all the folders of how to navigate to a file</p>
        <p><strong>What is a default document?</strong></p>
        <p> Its a file that is called index.html, it is the file that will open if the user navigate to a folder.</p>
        <p><strong>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</strong></p>
        <p>Absolute link gives the full address of a file or page, but the relative link is easier to move or copy files/folders without breaking links and i would use relative because it has less stuff to type</p>
        <p><strong>List the 3 rules with relative links</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start from the current folder â€” the link points to a file or folder inside where you are now</li>
            <li>If you go back a folder then use ../ to move out of the folder then</li>
            <li>do not start with the / because that refers to the root which will amke it a absolute link and not a relative </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</strong></p>
        <p>no they do not need to be in the nav</p>
