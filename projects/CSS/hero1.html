        <h1>My Hero -  Tanjiro Kamado</h1>
        <p>Tanjiro Kamado from Demon Slayer is one of favourite Heros.What makes him stand out isn't just his strength or sword skills, but his kindness and compassion. Even though he faces demons, he still shows mercy and understanding because he knows that many of them were once human. After losing his family, Tanjiro stays strong for his sister Nezuko and fights to protect her and others. He never gives up, no matter how hard things get, and that makes him a true hero. Tanjiro inspires me because he proves that being strong isn't just about fighting but it's also about having a good heart and never losing hope.</p>
