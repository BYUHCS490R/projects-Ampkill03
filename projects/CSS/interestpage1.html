        <h1>My Interest - The World Of Anime</h1>
        <p>I like watching anime because it's creative and full of emotion. The world of anime is huge. It has all kinds of stories, from action and adventure to romance, comedy, and even deep life lessons. Each anime world feels different, with amazing art, music, and characters that make you feel like you're part of the story.</p>
        <p>What I love most is how anime can mix fantasy and reality so well. One moment you're watching giant robots fighting in space, and the next, you're following a quiet story about friendship or courage. It teaches a lot about life, teamwork, and never giving up, and sometimes it even connects to real feelings we go through.</p>
        <h3>About Links</h3>
        <p>A relative link connects one page or file to another within the same website or folder. It doesn't use the full web address, but a absolute link is a full web address that connects to a page on another website. It includes the entire URL, starting with https:// or http://, Unlike a relative link, it doesn't depend on your website's folder, it works anywhere because it points to a specific location on the internet.</p>
