        <h1>My Interest -  <span class="highlight">The World Of Anime</span> </h1>
        <p>I like watching anime because it's creative and full of emotion. The world of anime is huge. It has all kinds of stories, from action and adventure to romance, comedy, and even deep life lessons. Each anime world feels different, with amazing art, music, and characters that make you feel like you're part of the story.</p>
        <p>What I love most is how anime can mix fantasy and reality so well. One moment you're watching giant robots fighting in space, and the next, you're following a quiet story about friendship or courage. It teaches a lot about life, teamwork, and never giving up, and sometimes it even connects to real feelings we go through.</p>

            <h3>Absolute link VS Relative Link</h3>
            <p>A <strong>relative link</strong> connects one page or file to another within the same website or folder. It doesn't use the full web address, but an <strong>absolute link</strong> is a full web address that connects to a page on another website. It includes the entire URL, starting with https:// or http://, Unlike a relative link, it doesn't depend on your website's folder, it works anywhere because it points to a specific location on the internet.</p>

            <h2>My Color Choices</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I chose <span class="highlight">red (#ef4444)</span> to emphasize text because it stands out and represents the theme in <em>Demon Slayer</em>.</li>
                <li>I chose <span class="muted">gray (#7a7a7a)</span> to de-emphasize text because it looks softer and helps important text stand out more.</li>
                <li> I picked my colors based on Tanjiro Kamado's outfit</li>
