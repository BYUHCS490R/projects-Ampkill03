            <strong>Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS.</strong> 
        </p>
        <p>
            Inline CSS is written directly in the html tag using the style attribute, good for quick and ontime use changes.Embedded CSS in placed inside a style tag inside of the head section of the HTML file and is good for styling a single page , byut the External CSS  is written in a seperate file with .css not html file and then linked to the HTML file , allowing you to use it multiple times over multiple pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Explain why you should only use external CSS.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Its good to use the same sytle for all the pages or sites that are yours.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What is a selector used for?</strong></p>
        <p>
            It is made to target specific HTML element you want to style and tell the browser which element the CSS file applies too
